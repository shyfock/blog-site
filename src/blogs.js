        "content":"I started my programming journey when I was in secondary school. Back then, I joined an Infocomm club and I started to learn Scratch, a versatile drag-and-drop tool that teaches me simple logic flow, data conditioning and simple iteration loops. It got me so interested in programming that I spent hours making a flight simulator on Scratch.\n\nI was so into programming that I took the computing class for my GCE O Levels. There, I started learning my first real programming language and that was Python. I was learning data structuring, the basics of networking, functions and classes and much more. My computing teacher gave my classes a series of programming questions in a gamified manner. Each time we got an algorithm correct, we were awarded points. My friends and I will spend time after school trying to outdo each other.\n\nWith the experience I had, and the opportunities I was given, I decided to pursue a career in programming. I am currently studying Computer Science at the National University of Singapore. I am currently in my 3rd year and I am looking forward to my final year project and internship opportunities.",

        "content":"I remember hearing about StackUp the first time some months ago, that was by email advertising, and I registered immediately and tried to figure out what really was that page. The first two or three months had to pass until I discovered what was that web for. I let pass some quests because I didn't know what to do, even though I have read it. It was from about april 2022 that I saw a quest about the Algorand technology, I read it slowly and trying to get the main idea. Then I filled in the quiz and went beyond with all the subsequent quests. That was my first campaign, learning about Solidity language and some other packages to install, and even though I knew a few things about js, html and css, that was a weird campaign, but finally I finished all the quests on time. From then until now, I've been totally engaged with StackUp, always waiting for more campaigns to come, enjoying every topic, learning a lot about new technologies, and with an overcoming interest in the blockchain technology, I really enjoy learning blockchain protocols, that seems amazing.",
